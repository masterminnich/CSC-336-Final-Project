# CSC-336-Final-Project
Final Project for Bei Xiao's Web Programming class at American University. 
My idea was to create a website that helps students start their college search process.


##Technologies Used:
- [Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System: National Center for Education Statistics](https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/use-the-data)' "Compare Institutions" dataset. I downloaded the data a CSV file called "colleges2.csv".
- [Papa Parse 5 Library](https://www.papaparse.com/docs#data) to parse the local csv file.
- [MapBox API](https://www.mapbox.com/) to display results on an interactive map.
- [SimpleMaps "Selectable States" Demo javasript plugin](https://simplemaps.com/docs/selectable-states). I didn't want to spend all of my time creating a pretty map, so I decided to integrate this. 


##In the future...
I am interested in implementing the [DataTables plugin](https://datatables.net/) to clean up the results table.
