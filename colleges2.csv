It seeks to liberate and nurture the individuality  the creative intelligence  and the ethical and aesthetic sensibility of its students  to the end that their richly varied natural endowments will be directed toward self-fulfillment and toward constructive social purposes. We believe that these educational goals are best served by demanding of our students active participation in the planning of their own programs  and in the regulation of their own lives on campus. Student freedom is not the absence of restraint  however; it is rather the fullest possible substitution of habits of self-restraint for restraint imposed by others. The exercise of student freedom is the very condition of a meaningful education  and an essential aspect of the nurture of free citizens  dedicated to civilized values and capable of creative and constructive membership in modern society.,93,22,50,38159,61,50,66,0,

Educational institutions have an obligation to become civically engaged in order to enrich and to better society. Institutions of higher education must be ethically vigilant  consciously exploring normative and moral issues. Knowledge consists of more than facts and has more than merely utilitarian ends; knowledge pursues and reflects values. Education is immeasurably enriched by the experience and insight of those outside the educational community. Human diversity is indispensable for improving the quality and texture of the education experience. Ongoing education is a lifelong responsibility of the global community’s leaders.    Advanced education is essential for the well-being and future of an increasingly complex society. Claremont Graduate University is an independent institution  striking in its global linkages and partnerships  innovative in the ways it teaches  characterized by continuous reconfiguration  responsive in its research to social issues and needs  and sensitive to aesthetic and moral dimensions of professional life.,,,,,,,,,

The college's mission remains fundamentally the same today.  The college fulfills this mission by offering degree and non-degree programs that develop professional competencies for business careers and provide a general education to contribute to the intellectual and emotional growth of each student.  The various programs meet student needs and the demands of the area community.  The measure of the college's success will be evidenced by the success of its graduates in finding relevant employment; by the partnerships the college has forged with the business community; and by the opportunities available to students interested in pursuing additional education.  Jamestown Business College is dedicated to the belief that its programs should not only prepare students to enter the workforce but also to take part fully in today's society.  The college offers general education courses to assist students to think logically and critically  to improve their communication skills  to achieve self-knowledge  to work cooperatively in teams  and to develop an appreciation of life-long learning.  All of these are essential skills for graduates to possess in our rapidly changing society and increasingly complex workplace.  All students are encouraged by the faculty and staff to achieve their academic and personal potential.  To accomplish this  the college provides a supportive environment in which students have access to a range of academic  personal  and career services.  It is also important to the college that its student body represents all segments of the diverse community that it serves  adding richness and strength to the teaching and learning process.,98,82,9,13140,90,90,90,25,

Pardee RAND is the only public policy program that focuses exclusively on the Ph.D. and the only program that is part of a public policy research institute--the RAND Corporation (RAND)  where policy analysis was born. Although Pardee RAND is not part of a university  it is nonetheless committed to the same openness and support of independent inquiry that characterize graduate study in university settings.    Pardee RAND’s mission is to provide the next generation of policy leaders an unsurpassed education in the fundamental tools of policy analysis.  The School’s overarching goals are:    1.	To produce Ph.D. graduates whose dissertations make important intellectual contributions to practical issues and whose careers distinguish them as powerful intellectual influences on public life through ideas and actions   2.	In conjunction with RAND  to develop new lines of teaching and research on some of the world’s most difficult policy challenges  and  3.	For the profession as a whole  to help rethink what public policy means in a time when effective governance increasingly relies on partnerships among government  business  and civil society.    Pardee RAND has identified five key educational objectives for students in the program:    1.	To understand the purpose of policy analysis and its place within the political process   2.	To master the basic methodologies used in policy research: economic analysis  quantitative methods  and social and behavioral science methods   3.	To acquire an in-depth knowledge in at least one of these three methodological fields   4.	To obtain a deep understanding of a specialized substantive field of public policy  and  5.	To develop project and professional skills relevant to the selected field of policy analysis.,,,,,,,,,

To provide a comprehensive understanding of person  marriage  and family  faithful to the Catholic tradition and in light of the teachings of the Second Vatican Council and Pope John Paul II  and  reciprocally  to explore the implications of this understanding for the whole of theology and philosophy—all by means of a multidisciplinary education centered in theology and philosophy and integrated in light of John Paul II’s notion of man and woman as an embodied  sexually differentiated communion of persons created in the image of God and destined for a state of life;  2.	To develop a critical understanding of issues on marriage and family  biotechnology  and ethics in light of Western/modern assumptions regarding the human person  as these bear on the nature and dignity of human life and the transcendental meaning of beauty  truth  and goodness  in a way that fosters a unity of theory and practice at the service of the Church’s “new evangelization”;  3.	To offer accredited pontifical degree programs  as well as civilly accredited graduate degree programs (master’s  license  and doctoral-level education);  4.	To prepare graduates (laypersons  priests  and religious) for teaching and research in academic  seminary  and diocesan contexts; for work in legal  medical  and other professional occupations; and for evangelization of the family as the foundation for the development of a “culture of life” leading to the creation of a “civilization of love”; and  5.	To undertake significant research and publication relative to the contemporary discussion regarding person  marriage  and family  and the implications of the Church’s teachings on these matters for broader problems in theology  philosophy  and culture.,,,,,,,,,
